Day 14 of Spring Boot: Leveling Up API Security! <br>

Today’s Spring Boot journey was all about advanced authentication techniques! Here’s what I learned: <br>

1) JDBC Authentication (Plain Text): Stored and authenticated users using plain text passwords with JDBC. <br>
2) BCrypt Encryption: Upgraded security by hashing passwords with BCrypt. <br>
3) Custom Tables for JDBC Auth: Configured Spring Security to work with custom database tables.
